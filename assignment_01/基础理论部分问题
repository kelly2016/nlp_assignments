0. Can you come up out 3 sceneraies which use AI methods?
Ans: 1. Image recognition
     2. Face recognition
     3. Artificial Intelligence Customer Service

1. How do we use Github; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;
Ans: we push our codes to Github to share them.
     Jupyter Notebook is for demonstrative purposes
     PyCharm is one of the most widely used IDEs for Python programming


2. What's the Probability Model?
Ans:A probability model is a mathematical representation of a random phenomenon

3. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Probability Model?
Ans:1。Spam filtering
    2。Chinese spell checker

4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?
Ans: It is too Rich in syntax to match

5. What's the Language Model;
Ans:A statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.It's also a funtion that input is a sentence
   output is a number which is Between 0 and 1.

6. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Language Model?
Ans:1。Spam filtering
    2。Chinese spell checker

7. What's the 1-gram language model;
Ans:1-gram is unigram，P(w1,w2,⋯,wm)=P(w1)p(w2)....p(wm).every word is independent.

8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;
Ans: Disadvantages:Every word is independent,lost a lot of context information
     Advantages:The numerator and denominator of the probability estimate do not show a 0, so this probability estimate is very well defined


9. What't the 2-gram models;
Ans: 2-gram is bigram ，P(w1,w2,⋯,wm)=P(w1)p(w2|w1)p(w3|w2)....p(wm|wm-1)
