1. Why do we need machine learning methods instead of creating a complicated formula?
Ans:In fact,it is too difficult to find a formula to solve those problems

2. Wha't's the disadvantages of the 1st Random Choosen methods in our course?
Ans:It would need longer to find the optimal solution

3. Is the 2nd method supervised direction better than 1st one? What's the disadvantages of the 2nd supversied directin method?
Ans: Yes， the 2nd method  is better than 1st one。
     The disadvantages：
     1）If the function is complicated and has many  coefficients，it
 would have a lot of the directions of changes 。
     2）Every time ，the next direction is not sure, it  may be better or be worse

4. Why do we use Derivative / Gredient to fit a target function?
Ans:It can  accelerate the speed of fitting

5. In the words 'Gredient Descent', what's the Gredient and what's the Descent?
Ans:Gredient is  the derivative in the multi-dimensional space
    Descent means that gredient  always decreases,until finding a local minimum of a function

6. What's the advantages of the 3rd gradient descent method compared to the previous methods?
Ans: The 3rd gradient descent method can always keep the direction  right

7. Using the simple words to describe: What's the machine leanring.
Ans:  automatic
