Why do we need dynamic programming? What's the difference of dynamic programming and previous talked search problme?

Ans:sorry,I really have no idear 　(°_°)

Why do we still need dynamic programming? Why not we train a machine learning to fit a function which could get the right answer based on inputs?

Ans: we should use proper method to solve the problem.
    And sometimes, it is not necessary  to use machine learning for some problems,
